# CS-MINOR PROJECT

The following scheduling algorithms will be implemented:
<ul>
  <li>First-come, first-served (FCFS), which schedules tasks in the order in which they request the CPU.</li>
  <li>Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the tasksâ€™ next CPU burst.</li>
  <li>Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority.</li>
  <li>Round-robin (RR) scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum (or for the remainder of its CPU burst).</li>
  <li>Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.</li>
</ul>

<p>Priorities range from 1 to 10, where a higher numeric value indicates a higher relative priority. For round-robin scheduling, the length of a time quantum is 10 milliseconds.</p>
