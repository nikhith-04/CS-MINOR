### CS-MINOR PROJECT

The following scheduling algorithms will be implemented:

First-come, first-served (FCFS), which schedules tasks in the order in which they request the CPU.
Shortest-job-first (SJF), which schedules tasks in order of the length of the tasksâ€™ next CPU burst.
Priority scheduling, which schedules tasks based on priority.
Round-robin (RR) scheduling, where each task is run for a time quantum (or for the remainder of its CPU burst).
Priority with round-robin, which schedules tasks in order of priority and uses round-robin scheduling for tasks with equal priority.
Priorities range from 1 to 10, where a higher numeric value indicates a higher relative priority. For round-robin scheduling, the length of a time quantum is 10 milliseconds.
